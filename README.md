# Abstract

The steps suggested include topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), using scientific papers 
ranging from abstracts to cluster them. The main aim is to search for assimilative patterns based on the extensive 
contextual database in order to facilitate greater organization within scientific research key areas. To this end, 
the research will utilize the basic clustering methods like K-Means along with Hierarchical Clustering and Topic 
Modeling by LDA. Through the incorporation of LDA during clustering the researchers hope to get even more 
refined relations between the papers and get a proper clustering of the documents into groups with related 
themes. Preprocessing in the context of data preprocessing entails the following process: It involves acquiring 
the abstracts of scientific papers and preprocessing the data which include the tokenization, stopword 
elimination, and stemming/lemmatization of the papers. K-Means, and hierarchical clustering will be used to 
cluster a set of scientific papers as used in the traditional approaches. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) 
will then be applied to the set of the preprocessed abstracts to discover topics that are otherwise not discernible. 
The employment of LDA based topic modeling after clustering shall enable the researchers to identify both 
broad association between papers and in-depth grouping of documents pertinent to content thematic similarity 
of papers. The presented approach is expected to benefit researchers as it can offer a rich interface to search 
related works and technical studies, enhance interdisciplinary interactions and facilitate progress of prior 
knowledge in designated scientific fields. The anticipated benefits are presented by: better organization and 
understanding of the vast amount of scientific knowledge; potential for discovering the hidden patterns in the 
field of scientific literature; effectiveness in interdisciplinary cooperation; and general progress in scientific 
cognition in several scientific fields.


# Objectives of the project
1. Develop an unsupervised machine learning framework for clustering scientific papers based on abstracts.
2. Utilize Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to extract underlying themes.
3. Evaluate clustering algorithms and combinations to optimize organization of literature.
4. Create a user-friendly interface for interactive exploration of clustered papers.
5. Assess the impact of the system on researchers' efficiency in accessing and comprehending literature.
